# Logo

The logo was built with the Varela Round font and three balls of different colors from the UIBCDF logo.

In order to create a logo for the website, the text "ElasNetMT" was written using
the Varela Round font and later the letters were then converted to paths to allow for
further manipulation. This resulting image was saved as an Inkscape SVG file
name "logo_paths.svg" to then be copied as docs/_static/logo.svg.
