# Sandbox

This directory is a playground for trying out ideas, running interactive
experiments, or drafting short notes while working on PyUnitWizard.

- Nothing in `sandbox/` is imported by the package, used in documentation
  builds, or exercised by automated tests.
- Prefer lightweight notebooks or scripts with clear names so other
  contributors can understand their purpose.
- Clean up obsolete files once an experiment is complete, and keep large data
  sets or generated artifacts out of the repository.
- When sharing findings, copy any relevant code into the proper module or
  documentation page rather than referencing the sandbox.

Refer to `sandbox/AGENTS.md` for additional guidance before committing changes here.
